# MusiCV
This is a music game that is controlled by finger gesture. All the computer vision algorithms are from opencv library

# Description
This is the term project I did when I was taking 15112 in CMU Pre-college program. It’s basically a rhythm game. However, instead of controlling with buttons or a mouse, this game is controlled by finger gesture. My algorithm can recognize the position of player’s finger tip by using any webcam. Therefore, it’s like a combination of guitarhero and computer vision. Also, my game allows player to customize the computer vision algorithm. Players can adjust the threshold(sensitivity) and choose between different kinds of bluring algorithm.
